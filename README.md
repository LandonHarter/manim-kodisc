# What is manim-kodisc?

AI tends to struggle with creating complex animations. manim-kodisc is a small manim plugin that makes the AI's life a little easier by providing a set of miscellaneous functions and animations that can be used to create more complex animations. By providing a base set of animations, our AI can focus on creating beautiful animations faster and with less errors (don't worry you guys can use it too).
